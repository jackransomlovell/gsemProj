# Applied Regression Project
This repository was used for completing the Applied REgression final project at CU Boulder in collaboration with Ziwei and Frida.
The project consisted of collecting summary statistics of genome wide association studies (GWAS) for phenotypes relation to mental health
and submitting those data to a genomic structural equation model (gSEM) to determine which SNPs were shared and potentially causual for 
comobridity in mental health disorders. The project recieved an A, please email jack.lovell@colorado.edu with any questions.
